DIY Pick and Place Hardware Files
===========================

This repository contains CNC cut/drill files and design files for the DIY pick and place machines which are detailed on my blog at:

http://briandorey.com/category/DIY-Pick-and-Place.aspx

The repository contains two root folders:

**Auto Pick and Place Machine** - This folder contains design and cnc files for the automatic diy pick and place machine.

**Manual Pick and Place Machine** - This folder contains design and cnc files for the manual pick and place machine.

All the design files are in Adobe Illustrator format. Not all the folders contain the design files as some parts were very simple so we only saved the cut .nc and drill files.

The CNC files were produced using CamBam studio from http://www.cambam.info/
